Hey, I have completed task 1 and task 2.

I have used React.js + Express.js to build this application.
Why this? Because Im well versed with this tech stack.

For display bar charts, I have used Chart.js library.

How to set locally?

1. Clone the repo
2. cd backend then 'npm install' then 'npm start'
3. cd frontend tehn npm install then 'npm run dev'

Go to http://localhost:5173/

You can watch a quick demo video here: https://youtu.be/DLj7w133-H0

Waiting for your response
Thanks
